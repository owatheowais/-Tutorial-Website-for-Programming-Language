Active Server Pages (ASP) gives you the freedom to add advanced features to your website.<p style="width: 949px; margin-left: 40px">
&nbsp;The aim of this tutorial is to give you an easy, yet thorough and correct introduction to ASP. It starts from scratch but requires that you already have a good knowledge of HTML. If you are new to HTML, you should start with our HTML tutorial.

ASP can be used in many contexts - discussion forums, polls, shops, SMS gateways, mailing lists, etc.<p style="width: 949px; margin-left: 40px">
&nbsp;The only limitation with what you choose to do with ASP is your imagination. ASP is not hard to learn, but be aware that ASP is more sophisticated and demanding to learn than HTML. Therefore, patience in the process is a virtue.

&nbsp;Next, you need access to a computer or a server that can run ASP. In contrast to HTML and CSS, ASP is not affected by which browser your visitor use, but by the type of server hosting your pages. This is because ASP is a server-side technology.
