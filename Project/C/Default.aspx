         C is a high-level programming language that was developed in the mid-1970s. It 
         was originally used for writing Unix programs, but is now used to write 
         applications for nearly every available platform. Compared to most previous 
         languages, C is easier to read, more flexible (can be used for a wide variety of 
         purposes), and more efficient at using memory.</p>

         C++, pronounced &quot;C plus plus,&quot; is a programming language that was built off the 
         C language. The syntax of C++ is nearly identical to C, but it has 
         object-oriented features, which allow the programmer to create objects within 
         the code. This makes programming easier, more efficient, and some would even 
         say, more fun. Because of the power and flexibility of the language, most 
         software programs today are written in C++.</p>
